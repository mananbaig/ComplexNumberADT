# ComplexNumberADT

A Complex Number Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a mathematical construct used in programming to represent complex numbers, which have a real part and an imaginary part. Here's a breakdown of what a Complex Number ADT typically includes:

Components of a Complex Number
Real Part: The real component of the complex number (denoted as 
𝑎
a).
Imaginary Part: The imaginary component, typically expressed as 
𝑏
𝑖
bi, where 
𝑏
b is a real number and 
𝑖
i is the imaginary unit.
